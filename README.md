There are 17 matlab programs are there for preprocessing and postprocessing wave model outputdata and its validation with observation
1. fre_energy_plot.m (It will take the observation data and plot the two dimensional frequency and energy plot)
2. gapfill_spt_energy_exttract.m (It take the spectral file and fill the gap with nan for energy column with respect to time period)
3. his_modify.m (Modify the observed buoy history file for model validation)
4. mb_collocation_gapfill.m (It will take the observation moored buoy data and model output at that location and collocate temporally with gapfill)
5. monthwise_stati_comb.m (It will take observation and model output for all locations then calculate the statistics for them)
6. Then all other programs are also used for validation and visualization purpose.
